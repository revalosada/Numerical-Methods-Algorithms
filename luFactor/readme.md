##LU Factorization
Function will return the LU factorization of any square matrix

##Break script
Script was written to test the LU factor function. It accomplishes this by generating random integer matrices,
running them through the LU factor function, and then testing the validity of the returned matrices from the function.
Using this I have run my LU factor function through over a million iterations, with no failures!
