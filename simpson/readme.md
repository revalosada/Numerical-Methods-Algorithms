##Simpson function
Function uses the composite simpson 1/3 rule to estimate the integer of data points made up of discrete values.
It analyzes the input values to determine if the data set can be integrated using the simpsons method, decides if it 
needs to use an instance of the trapezoid rule, and then performs calculations.

##Simpsons test
This script was provided in the assignment for use in testing the Simpson function. It utilizes two methods of integration, one
is a built in matlab function, the other is the simpsons function. If the output of the function outputs values that are close
to each other for each respective data set, the function worked properly.
